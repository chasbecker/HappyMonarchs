# HappyMonarchs
Of the top 8 USAToday "happiest countries", how many have or had monarchs?

Five of the top 8 currently happiest countries are constitutional monarchies.  
Two were or are vestigal monarchies.
One was ruled by nobles whose positions were eliminated in 1848.

The majority of happiest countries are constitutiona monarchies.
Monarchs are largely ceremonial, but they serve a far more important function than "ruling".
They are the non-partisan symbol of national identity.  They are responsible to the country
and the people, but they do not have to campaign for votes or fear a vote of no confidence.  Not
surprinsghingly, constitutional monarchs are quite popular in their domains.

Not on this list are the grand dames of monarchies: Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
